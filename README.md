# PasswordKeeper
Application to safely store user credentials. 

To run application you need to download folder content: Mimix_password_keeper 

and run it with the created program - Mimix_win.sh - you can create shortcut on the desktop and run it from there. 

Right now there is only version for Windows users. In future, there might also be a version for Linux users. (Need to update OS GUI libraries)
